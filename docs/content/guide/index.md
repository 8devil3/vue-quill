# Getting Started

## What is Quill

**Quill** is a modern rich text editor built for compatibility and extensibility. It was created by Jason Chen and Byron Milligan and actively maintained by [Slab](https://slab.com/).

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Quill](https://quilljs.com/guides/why-quill/) guides.

## What is VueUpQuill

**VueUpQuill** is a **Vue Component** for building rich text editors, this package is a thin wrapper around Quill to make it easier to use in a Vue 3 application.

## Browser Support

Cross platform support is important to many Javascript libraries, but the criteria for what this means often differs. For Quill, the bar is not just that it runs or works, it has to run or work the same way. Not only is functionality a cross platform consideration, but user and developer experience is as well. If some content produces a particular markup in Chrome on OSX, it will produce the same markup on IE. If hitting enter preserves bold format state in Firefox on Windows, it will be preserved on mobile Safari.

Quill supports all modern browsers on desktops, tablets and phones. Experience the same consistent behavior and produced HTML across platforms. [See the chart](https://github.com/quilljs/quill/#readme) for more details.
