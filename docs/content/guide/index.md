# Introduction

## What is Quill

**Quill** is a modern rich text editor built for compatibility and extensibility. It was created by Jason Chen and Byron Milligan and actively maintained by [Slab](https://slab.com/).

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Quill](https://quilljs.com/guides/why-quill/) guides.

## What is VueQuill

**VueQuill** is a **Vue Component** for building rich text editors, this package is a thin wrapper around Quill to make it easier to use in a Vue 3 application.

## Browser Support

Cross-platform support is important to many Javascript libraries, but the criteria for what this means often differ. For Quill, the bar is not just that it runs or works, it has to run or work the same way. Not only is functionality a cross-platform consideration, but the user and developer experience are as well. If some content produces a particular markup in Chrome on OSX, it will produce the same markup on IE. If hitting enter preserves bold format state in Firefox on Windows, it will be preserved on mobile Safari.

Quill supports all modern browsers on desktops, tablets, and phones. Experience the same consistent behavior and produced HTML across platforms. [See the chart](https://github.com/quilljs/quill/#readme) for more details.
